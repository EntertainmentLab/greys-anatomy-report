        Study Overview
      </h2>
      <p>
        To investigate the potential of entertainment media to influence public understanding of climate-related health risks, we conducted a randomized controlled trial examining audience responses to a storyline in Grey's Anatomy. Building on prior work demonstrating that brief, contextually relevant portrayals can influence food norms and climate-related beliefs, this study focused on extreme heat as a salient and underrepresented climate threat.

        Participants viewed Season 21 episode 8 ("Drop it Like it's Hot") of Grey's Anatomy featuring a storyline in which a record-breaking heatwave strains the capacity of Seattle hospitals. The episode did not mention climate change explicitly but depicted the cascading consequences of heat—power outages, overwhelmed emergency services, and ethical challenges in triage—as core narrative elements, allowing us to assess whether a dramatic medical narrative could affect beliefs about personal risk, institutional vulnerability, and public responsibility.

        In addition to assessing the effects of narrative content alone, the study also tested the additional value of supplemental impact media. Half of the participants who watched the heatwave episode were shown one of four short-form social media videos immediately after viewing the episode. These Instagram videos, produced independently by advocacy organizations during the show's original airing, explicitly connected the events of the episode to climate science, heatwave impacts, and health system resilience.
